## Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering

### Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, and Feature Engineering to prepare the data for machine learning.

### Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival status. Our goal is to transform the data to extract meaningful insights and create a well-preprocessed dataset.

### Steps Performed

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Understanding Dataset
- Handling Missing Values
- Duplicates
- Outliers

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Extracted Features
- Encoding And Scaling

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

### Outcome
After preprocessing and feature engineering, the dataset is now clean, well-structured.
